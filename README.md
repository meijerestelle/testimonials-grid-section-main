### Links

- Live Site URL: https://testimonials-grid-section-main-psi-jade.vercel.app/(https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I used this challenge to further get back to my HTML/CSS knowledge. 

- I learned that the best way to add something 'in the background' is to simply implement it as a background. This way you don't have to try and use z-index.
- I had to look up the whole grid concept, so I understand it again. Apart from the notation itself, I understood the concept. So that went well.
- Again I learned how to center content in a single view webpage, like previous challenges.

### Continued development

In future challenges I will probably dive into SASS or SCSS, as recommended in feedback given on earlier challenges.
